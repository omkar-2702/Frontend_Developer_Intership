# Basic Web Calculator

## Overview
Short description of what the calculator does and why it was built (assignment / learning project). [file:1]

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. [file:1]  
- Correct order of operations (BODMAS). [file:1]  
- Support for decimals and parentheses. [file:1]  
- Extra functions: square root, percentage, memory (M+, M-, MR, MC).  
- Calculation history saved in browser (localStorage).  
- Keyboard input support (numbers, operators, Enter, Backspace, etc.).  

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure all project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same folder. [file:1]  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  

## Usage
- Click the on-screen buttons or use the keyboard to enter numbers and operators.  
- Press `=` to evaluate the expression.  
- Use `C` to clear the current expression.  
- Use extra buttons:
  - `√` for square root
  - `%` for percentage
  - `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, `MC` for memory
  - `History` to view past calculations, `Clear History` to reset  
- Test different expressions to verify all operations and error handling. [file:1]

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Calculator UI layout. [file:1]  
- `style.css` – Styling for the calculator interface. [file:1]  
- `script.js` – Logic for operations, memory, history, and input handling. [file:1]  

## Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## Future Improvements (Optional)
- Add more advanced scientific functions.  
- Improve responsive design for mobile devices.  
- Add tests for calculator functions.
